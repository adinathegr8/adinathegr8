I'm totally stuck on this one code we need to write!!
It's asking me to: Write a program which the user is asked repeatedly to input integers from 1 to 5. 
The program should inform the user when they enter an integer that puts the sum of the input integers over 21.
In addition to printing the message "Over 21", the computer should print the sum and the last integer entered.

I so far wrote this but i don't think i'm on the right track!

number = range(1, 6) # Get a number between [1 and 6). 
guesses = 0  
message = ""
while True: 
  guess = int(input("\nGuess my number between 1 and 6: "))
  guesses += 1
  if guess == 21:
    break
    
my output just asks me to input a number over and over again...
